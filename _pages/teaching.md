I have done a lot of teaching next to my studies. Not only do I like the interaction with students, but it also forces one to extend their knowledge of the subject to a higher level. My responsibilities consist of helping the students with exercises during tutorials and grading exercises. 

For the course Methods and Models in Complex Systems I have also been responsible for developing all the graded exercises and putting together the tutorial exercises.

I have been a teaching assistant at the Utrecht University mathematics/physics departments at the
following bachelor courses.

* Infinitesimaalrekening en Lineaire Algebra 1 (2022).
* Methods and Models in Complex Systems (2021).  
* Introduction to Stochastic Processes (2021).  
* Methods and Models in Complex Systems (2020).  
* Introduction to Financial Mathematics (2019).  
* Introduction to Geometry (2019).  
* Mathematical Techniques 2 (2019).  
* Mathematical Techniques 1 (2018).  
* Introduction to Financial Mathematics (2018).
