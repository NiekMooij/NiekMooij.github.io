I have been a member of the board of organizers of the μ-games. This is a competition in mathematical problem solving, organized by the Utrecht University mathematics department, and aimed at students from Utrecht University.

In this competition, the aim is to introduce students to the use of a computer when solving mathematical problems. As a board of organizers, we have been responsible for creating the exercises and managing the Domjudge environment that is being used to evaluate the solutions posted by students.

A possible exercise (one that was actually used in the third edition of this event) is the following.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/MuGamesExercise.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<!-- <div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div> -->

At the moment if am not anymore involved directly with this event, but for questions you can always contact me or take a look at the <a href="https://clover.science.uu.nl/"> website </a>.
